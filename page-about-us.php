              <p>I went to Ability Plus a little over a year ago, I wasn't 100% sure at the time I wanted to move but I was starting to feel like I needed a change, Monique was incredibly helpful and immediately put me at ease, she offered me a few options, one of which I was keen on progressing and seeing how it went.  The process was great, I was kept well informed throughout, I was told about every step I would be going through during the hiring process, and not once was I left wondering what was going on.  A year on and I love my "new" job, I feel I was incredibly well matched to the company which is a good skill to have as a recruitment agency! In short I would definitely recommend them if you're thinking of a move.</p>
